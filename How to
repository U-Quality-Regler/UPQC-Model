The latest version rich in detail is explained in the paper:
Performance Analysis of a 50 kVA Unified Power Quality Conditioner Model for Low Voltage Distribution Network Application_v3.pdf

Usage of the model is explained in pictures here:

The model was developed in different levels of details of simulations of an UPQC model.
Parts/Subsystems, which are commented out in the model, can be used for simulations with less details of the model.
